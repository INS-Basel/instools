Complete redcap usernames based on csv-filled-lists with names and email addresses

\details{
Admins have the rights to add additional users to REDCap. The PI or data managers of a
project is responsible to fill out the user form and send it via Email to the admin.
The admin fills out the usernames according to a standardized rule (handle of the email-adress).
When bulk-adding multiple users, this is tedious. This function fills completes the
user names automatically and saves the file as a .csv in the same directory as the
supplied file.
